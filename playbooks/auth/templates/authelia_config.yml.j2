## Default redirection URL
##
## If user tries to authenticate without any referer, Authelia does not know where to redirect the user to at the end
## of the authentication process. This parameter allows you to specify the default redirection URL Authelia will use
## in such a case.
##
## Note: this parameter is optional. If not provided, user won't be redirected upon successful authentication.

##
## NTP Configuration
##
## This is used to validate the servers time is accurate enough to validate TOTP.
ntp:
  ## NTP server address.
  address: "time.cloudflare.com:123"

  ## NTP version.
  version: 4

  ## Maximum allowed time offset between the host and the NTP server.
  max_desync: 3s

  ## Disables the NTP check on startup entirely. This means Authelia will not contact a remote service at all if you
  ## set this to true, and can operate in a truly offline mode.
  disable_startup_check: false

  ## The default of false will prevent startup only if we can contact the NTP server and the time is out of sync with
  ## the NTP server more than the configured max_desync. If you set this to true, an error will be logged but startup
  ## will continue regardless of results.
  disable_failure: false

##
## Authentication Backend Provider Configuration
##
## Used for verifying user passwords and retrieve information such as email address and groups users belong to.
##
## The available providers are: `file`, `ldap`. You must use only one of these providers.
authentication_backend:

  ## Password Reset Options.
  password_reset:
    ## Disable both the HTML element and the API for reset password functionality.
    disable: false

    ## External reset password url that redirects the user to an external reset portal. This disables the internal reset
    ## functionality.
    custom_url: ""

  ## The amount of time to wait before we refresh data from the authentication backend. Uses duration notation.
  ## To disable this feature set it to 'disable', this will slightly reduce security because for Authelia, users will
  ## always belong to groups they belonged to at the time of login even if they have been removed from them in LDAP.
  ## To force update on every request you can set this to '0' or 'always', this will increase processor demand.
  ## See the below documentation for more information.
  ## Duration Notation docs:  https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ## Refresh Interval docs: https://www.authelia.com/c/1fa#refresh-interval
  refresh_interval: 5m

  ##
  ## LDAP (Authentication Provider)
  ##
  ## This is the recommended Authentication Provider in production
  ## because it allows Authelia to offload the stateful operations
  ## onto the LDAP service.
  ldap:
    ## The LDAP implementation, this affects elements like the attribute utilised for resetting a password.
    ## Acceptable options are as follows:
    ## - 'activedirectory' - For Microsoft Active Directory.
    ## - 'custom' - For custom specifications of attributes and filters.
    ## This currently defaults to 'custom' to maintain existing behaviour.
    ##
    ## Depending on the option here certain other values in this section have a default value, notably all of the
    ## attribute mappings have a default value that this config overrides, you can read more about these default values
    ## at https://www.authelia.com/c/ldap#defaults
    implementation: custom

    ## The url to the ldap server. Format: <scheme>://<address>[:<port>].
    ## Scheme can be ldap or ldaps in the format (port optional).
    url: ldap://localhost:3890

    ## The dial timeout for LDAP.
    # timeout: 5s

    ## Use StartTLS with the LDAP connection.
    start_tls: false

    base_dn: dc=sladnet,dc=xyz
    username_attribute: uid
    additional_users_dn: ou=people

    users_filter: (&(|({username_attribute}={input})({mail_attribute}={input}))(objectClass=person))
    additional_groups_dn: ou=groups

    groups_filter: (member={dn})

    ## The attribute holding the name of the group.
    group_name_attribute: cn

    ## The attribute holding the mail address of the user. If multiple email addresses are defined for a user, only the
    ## first one returned by the LDAP server is used.
    mail_attribute: mail

    ## The attribute holding the display name of the user. This will be used to greet an authenticated user.
    display_name_attribute: displayName

    ## Follow referrals returned by the server.
    ## This is especially useful for environments where read-only servers exist. Only implemented for write operations.
    # permit_referrals: false

    ## The username and password of the admin user.
    user: cn=admin,ou=people,dc=sladnet,dc=xyz
    ## Password can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
    password: {{ lldap_admin_password }}

##
## Password Policy Configuration.
##
password_policy:

  ## The standard policy allows you to tune individual settings manually.
  standard:
    enabled: false

    ## Require a minimum length for passwords.
    min_length: 8

    ## Require a maximum length for passwords.
    max_length: 0

    ## Require uppercase characters.
    require_uppercase: true

    ## Require lowercase characters.
    require_lowercase: true

    ## Require numeric characters.
    require_number: true

    ## Require special characters.
    require_special: true

  ## zxcvbn is a well known and used password strength algorithm. It does not have tunable settings.
  zxcvbn:
    enabled: false

    ## Configures the minimum score allowed.
    min_score: 3

##
## Access Control Configuration
##
## Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one resource to users or group of users.
##
## If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and the 'bypass' rule is applied, i.e., access is allowed
## to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow the rules defined.
##
## Note: One can use the wildcard * to match any subdomain.
## It must stand at the beginning of the pattern. (example: *.example.com)
##
## Note: You must put patterns containing wildcards between simple quotes for the YAML to be syntactically correct.
##
## Definition: A 'rule' is an object with the following keys: 'domain', 'subject', 'policy' and 'resources'.
##
## - 'domain' defines which domain or set of domains the rule applies to.
##
## - 'subject' defines the subject to apply authorizations to. This parameter is optional and matching any user if not
##    provided. If provided, the parameter represents either a user or a group. It should be of the form
##    'user:<username>' or 'group:<groupname>'.
##
## - 'policy' is the policy to apply to resources. It must be either 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'.
##
## - 'resources' is a list of regular expressions that matches a set of resources to apply the policy to. This parameter
##   is optional and matches any resource if not provided.
##
## Note: the order of the rules is important. The first policy matching (domain, resource, subject) applies.
access_control:
  ## Default policy can either be 'bypass', 'one_factor', 'two_factor' or 'deny'. It is the policy applied to any
  ## resource if there is no policy to be applied to the user.
  default_policy: one_factor

        # - 'private.example.com'
    #   policy: two_factor

    # - domain: 'singlefactor.example.com'
    #   policy: one_factor

    ## Rules applied to 'admins' group

    #   resources:
    #     - '^/users/bob/.*$'
    #   subject: 'user:bob'
    #   policy: two_factor

##
## Session Provider Configuration
##
## The session cookies identify the user once logged in.
## The available providers are: `memory`, `redis`. Memory is the provider unless redis is defined.
session:
  ## The name of the session cookie.
  name: authelia_session

  ## The domain to protect.
  ## Note: the authenticator must also be in that domain.
  ## If empty, the cookie is restricted to the subdomain of the issuer.
  domain: sladnet.xyz

  ## Sets the Cookie SameSite value. Possible options are none, lax, or strict.
  ## Please read https://www.authelia.com/c/session#same_site
  same_site: lax

  ## The secret to encrypt the session data. This is only used with Redis / Redis Sentinel.
  ## Secret can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
  secret: {{ redis_secret }}

  ## The value for expiration, inactivity, and remember_me_duration are in seconds or the duration notation format.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ## All three of these values affect the cookie/session validity period. Longer periods are considered less secure
  ## because a stolen cookie will last longer giving attackers more time to spy or attack.

  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS NOT selected.
  expiration: 1h

  ## The inactivity time before the session is reset. If expiration is set to 1h, and this is set to 5m, if the user
  ## does not select the remember me option their session will get destroyed after 1h, or after 5m since the last time
  ## Authelia detected user activity.
  inactivity: 5m

  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS selected.
  ## Value of -1 disables remember me.
  remember_me_duration: 1M

  ##
  ## Redis Provider
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/t/statelessness
  ##
  redis:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 6379
    ## Use a unix socket instead
    # host: /var/run/redis/redis.sock

    ## Username used for redis authentication. This is optional and a new feature in redis 6.0.
    # username: authelia

    ## Password can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
    # password: authelia

    ## This is the Redis DB Index https://redis.io/commands/select (sometimes referred to as database number, DB, etc).
    database_index: 0

    ## The maximum number of concurrent active connections to Redis.
    maximum_active_connections: 8

    ## The target number of idle connections to have open ready for work. Useful when opening connections is slow.
    minimum_idle_connections: 0

##
## Regulation Configuration
##
## This mechanism prevents attackers from brute forcing the first factor. It bans the user if too many attempts are made
## in a short period of time.
regulation:
  ## The number of failed login attempts before user is banned. Set it to 0 to disable regulation.
  max_retries: 3

  ## The time range during which the user can attempt login before being banned. The user is banned if the
  ## authentication failed 'max_retries' times in a 'find_time' seconds window. Find Time accepts duration notation.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  find_time: 2m

  ## The length of time before a banned user can login again. Ban Time accepts duration notation.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ban_time: 5m

##
## Storage Provider Configuration
##
## The available providers are: `local`, `mysql`, `postgres`. You must use one and only one of these providers.
storage:
  ## The encryption key that is used to encrypt sensitive information in the database. Must be a string with a minimum
  ## length of 20. Please see the docs if you configure this with an undesirable key and need to change it, you MUST use
  ## the CLI to change this in the database if you want to change it from a previously configured value.
  encryption_key: {{ postgres_encryption_key }}

  ##
  ## PostgreSQL (Storage Provider)
  ##
  postgres:
    host: {{ hostvars['postgres'].ansible_host }}
    port: 5432
    database: authelia
    schema: public
    username: authelia
    ## Password can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
    password: {{ authelia_db_password }}
    timeout: 5s

##
## Notification Provider
##
## Notifications are sent to users when they require a password reset, a Webauthn registration or a TOTP registration.
## The available providers are: filesystem, smtp. You must use only one of these providers.
notifier:
  ## You can disable the notifier startup check by setting this to true.
  disable_startup_check: false

  ##
  ## File System (Notification Provider)
  ##
  ## Important: Kubernetes (or HA) users must read https://www.authelia.com/t/statelessness
  ##
  # filesystem:
    # filename: /config/notification.txt

  ##
  ## SMTP (Notification Provider)
  ##
  ## Use a SMTP server for sending notifications. Authelia uses the PLAIN or LOGIN methods to authenticate.
  ## [Security] By default Authelia will:
  ##   - force all SMTP connections over TLS including unauthenticated connections
  ##      - use the disable_require_tls boolean value to disable this requirement
  ##        (only works for unauthenticated connections)
  ##   - validate the SMTP server x509 certificate during the TLS handshake against the hosts trusted certificates
  ##     (configure in tls section)
  smtp:
    ## The SMTP host to connect to.
    host: smtp.mailbox.org

    ## The port to connect to the SMTP host on.
    port: 465

    ## The connection timeout.
    timeout: 5s

    ## The username used for SMTP authentication.
    username: {{ smtp_email }}

    ## The password used for SMTP authentication.
    ## Can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
    password: {{ smtp_password }}

    ## The sender is used to is used for the MAIL FROM command and the FROM header.
    ## If this is not defined and the username is an email, we use the username as this value. This can either be just
    ## an email address or the RFC5322 'Name <email address>' format.
    sender: "Authelia <authelia@sladnet.xyz>"

    ## HELO/EHLO Identifier. Some SMTP Servers may reject the default of localhost.
    # identifier: localhost

    ## Subject configuration of the emails sent. {title} is replaced by the text from the notifier.
    subject: "[Authelia] {title}"

    ## This address is used during the startup check to verify the email configuration is correct.
    ## It's not important what it is except if your email server only allows local delivery.
    startup_check_address: {{ smtp_email }}

    ## By default we require some form of TLS. This disables this check though is not advised.
    # disable_require_tls: false

    ## Disables sending HTML formatted emails.
    # disable_html_emails: false

    tls:
      minimum_version: TLS1.2
